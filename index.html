<p class="para_one">The first amongst many projects to reflect on how far I have come in my learning journey! What started out as an interest, later a hobby as you will come to see, lead to development and progress in programming.  After dabbling with various languages I am looking forward to showcase some of my work with much more projects on the way!  Enjoy!</p>

<p class="coffee_code">COFFEE & CODE</p>
<p2 class="para_two"> My journey began in the legal and financial services industries for many, many years to later find myself working for a global IT consultancy company albeit in a different remit.  An eagerness for programming sparked from supporting developers creating a web tool for a multi-million pound project that would allow greater efficiency for project analysts in our daily routines.  Also spurring me on were greatly supportive family and friends that were well-versed and experienced software engineers.  After listening to copious courses on concepts, reading literature and watching videos I was engulfed and engaged. There was no other option but to jump in the deep end.  Create code, projects and appllications.  Let the games begin!  My projects are primarily for functionality purposes and to practise code with different languages both back end and front end.  I have and will be creating simple, functional and fun projects!  With a hope to eventually create, clean and coherent code!!  During my coffee and code sessions I had gone through several online walk throughs or courses including:

    <li>Udacity Nano Degree</li>
    <li>Codeacademy</li>

        <p class="para_five"><i>A piece of personal advice from a friend and founder of multiple tech companies globally: when learning understand and embed the foundations of programming i.e. arrays, loops, if / else statements etc as the principles are the same just with different syntax that can be learnt.  Finally, do not stop coding - it is similar to an avid runner or gym goer, once you stop the muscle memory fades and it takes a while to learn or retain.  With the little that I know, it definitely holds true for myself and encourages me to, well...coffee and code! </i></p>
        <p class="para_five"> Feel free to contact me or share any advice or feedback on my projects - no doubt there is so much to learn!
